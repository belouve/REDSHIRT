1) Read into the Microsoft Securing Privileged Access Whitepaper

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/securing-privileged-access/securing-privileged-access

2) Review the malware archaeology logging cheatsheets which include the ATT&CK lateral movement guide, windows and powershell sheets
https://www.malwarearchaeology.com/cheat-sheets/

3) review all posts on adsecurity.org
http://adsecurity.org/

4) learn to use bloodhound defensively, collectionmethod All includes ACL abuses, run monthly

5) Disable LLMNR (link local multicast name resolution)

6) Disable WPAD (Windows Proxy Auto Discovery)

7) Disable NBT-NS (NetBIOS Name Services)
the following powershell will do it, push via GPO

$NetworkAdapters = (get-wmiobject win32_networkadapterconfiguration)
ForEach ($NetworkAdapterItem in $NetworkAdapters) { $NetworkAdapterItem.SetTCPIPNetbios(2) }

8) Enforce SMB Signing and disable SMBv1

9) Disable Powershell 2, enable powershell v5, deploy poweshell transcription block logging, module logging and script block logging

10) use microsoft ata (advanced threat analytics)

11) deploy PAW (privileged access workstations)
https://thycotic.com/glossary/privileged-access-workstations-paws/

12) deploy Red Forest design with full tier 0/1/2 isolation and Microsoft Privilege Identity Manager with dynamic privilege assignment
https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/37509.active-directory-red-forest-design-aka-enhanced-security-administrative-environment-esae.aspx
Has been replaced by RAMP:  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/compass/security-rapid-modernization-plan

13) deploy local admin password solution (LAPS)
-ensure all local admin passwords are different between workstations, servers and VDI's. Also remove universal local admin accounts.

14) remove local admin from users, ensure PAW's have no admin on that workstation for individual machine admins

15) deploy credential guard

16) deploy device guard

17) deploy exploit guard

18) deploy sysmon

19) deploy applocker

20) employ windows firewall blocking inbound 135-139, 389, 636 3389,445, 5985/5986 unless authentication through a VPN from managed workstations, also block these ports on internal and external network firewalls

21) make sure nac and va (Vuln Assessment) scanners don't spray creds

23) secure dynamic DNS updates
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/networking/configure-dns-dynamic-updates-windows-server-2003

24) purge group policy preferences files and unattended installation files

25) change the krbtgt hash twice a year

26) ensure there are no paths from kerberoastable users to high value targets such as domain admin

27) plant honey tokens and accounts to detect anomalous activity especially against kerberoasting with an SPN set

28) enforce LDAP signing and LDAP channel binding

29) mitigate a nasty exchange bug, details are here: https://dirkjanm.io/abusing-exchange-one-api-call-away-from-domain-admin/ There is a mitigations section, follow it completely including removing the excessive permissions

30) remove print spooler from domain controllers or sensitive servers, you can force the machines to authenticate and relay

31) follow mitigations here: https://dirkjanm.io/worst-of-both-worlds-ntlm-relaying-and-kerberos-delegation/

32) Deploy Windows 10, Server 2016

33) Use the Microsoft SECCON Framework
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-security-configuration-framework/windows-security-configuration-framework redirects to:
https://github.com/microsoft/SecCon-Framework/blob/master/windows-security-configuration-framework.md

34) Disable all Lanman responses in NTLM Challenges and NTLMv1 challenge response on clients and servers.
