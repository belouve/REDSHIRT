I'm dispensing my advice from this being year ten, and from the angle of being a worker/support and manning a booth (for most of my times there). Makes for a lot of walking and a lot of time staying put at a booth. (Note, I add and update this every year, and then save it because the question will always be asked again).

This needs to be updated, I think last pass through this was pre-COVID.

## **Fluids** (if any tl:dr -- keep fluids up at all cost)

Water flask - Go and get a durable bottle that you'll use the whole weekend to refill. I have a couple of [these water flasks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LF3IGQ/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1) You are going to want to drink the water down, and refill this when you can. I've found a lot of times there are water coolers, but the cups ran out. This flask tucks nicely into a bag or large pocket. Doesn't seem to leak or puncture.

Water additives - Go get something to add to your water for electolytes. Yes, you'll lose more than just water. Pack a small batch of something like [these NUUN tablets](https://www.amazon.com/Active-Effervescent-Electrolyte-Supplement-Lemon/dp/B01BTDN7T2/ref=sr_1_3?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1469388726&sr=1-3&keywords=nuun) and mix them into that water flask. Bonus, retain the little tube they came in to store lockpicks or whatever other little itmes you might accumulate.

Caffeine - you should do caffeine as the water additives. A lot of the "caffeine delivery systems" you will encounter will also dehydrate you. See the section on vitamins and drugs. There is also little refrigeration, so you'll just be drinking warm Mountain Dew. Get some caffeine with your meal if you need to.

Alcohol - you can use one of those water flasks to carry some booze. But one flask must be water at all times. I generally have two flasks on me, one of water, one of moonshine, etc. Minibottles are great too, you can get them at home and pack them into toiletries.

Note: I've stopped drinking for the duration of the con, since it is easy to get into a bad spot, dehydrated, and I've got contests depending on my help (plus you get to see more cool things). Just my stance after six years, and probably why the goons don't drink on the job: not that they can't, just that they are responsible. If not responsible for anything, hell, you're in Sin City, do what you want.

## **"The best things I put in my mouth all weekend of DEFCON":**

These [natural throat losenges](https://www.amazon.com/Thayers-Slippery-Lozenges-Maple-Pack/dp/B00FQEHGTI/ref=pd_lpo_121_tr_img_3?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=1JTWVKYREKA3NMNWEP4H) are great. I gave out all that I had to the good people working booths, and got the quoted reaction. It helps for just socializing an talking for hours and hours in the desert, and getting your voice back.

## **Snacks**

Protein - it's just natural energy. Get some protein bars, eat one each morning. Beef jerky works out well too. A lot of people crowd breakfast places, when you should be lining up for awesome things instead. You should also match this with water/electrolytes. It'll fuel you for the day.

Sugar - yeah, don't really load up on this. You'll just crash at the most inconvenient time. This ties into the sodas/caffeine thing.

Chips and General Snacks - sure, find these somewhere if you have to. Best place is offsite, head towards the Tuscany, and there's a 7Eleven over there. Or do a run with people to Wal-Mart or something. If you're doing that, get PB&J ingredients.

## **Drugs**

Multivitamins - Get some multivitamins, and start taking them now or in the month leading up to DEFCON. I generally take them to keep me on my game. Combats hangovers well.  Whatever pack is good for you.  I'll prpbably go with [this](https://www.amazon.com/ONNIT-Total-Human-Multivitamin-Essential/dp/B09885FTBK/ref=sr_1_3?crid=ABWLQT7H23GJ&keywords=onnit+7+day&qid=1658525902&sprefix=onnit+7day%2Caps%2C75&sr=8-3) for 2022

Vitamin D - this also rocks, and most of us won't see the sun for a few days anyways.

Hangover additives - again, back to that water flask. Use some sort of tablets [like these](https://www.amazon.com/Blowfish-for-Hangovers-12-Tablets/dp/B005EHQGCU/ref=sr_1_1_a_it?ie=UTF8&qid=1469389957&sr=8-1&keywords=hangover+tablets) I like tablets, because then you'll drink water. Just packing tylenol/asprin will generally get you to take a swallow of water with the pill, when you really should get a full flask of fluids, or more.

Anti-diarrhea drugs. I know there is the fun of Shittercon, but you eat some bad party food or share a flask with someone that has some bug, you'll rather have the anti-diarrhea drugs than become a Shittercon VIP. Plus, diarrhea dehydrates you in the desert.

## **Tech**

Ethernet cable - you'll at least want to try to be on wired vs wireless. Plus, you can connect into LAN Taps, etc., should anything like that arise among your buddies.

Laptop? - My thoughts, bring something. I've had years where I didn't use it. But having the ability to look something up, examine a forensics challenge, is useful.

Thumbdrives - useful for a LiveCD boot, and also useful if you need to take files that are being distributed. Copy off a new distro or a tool that is released. Again, be safe with taking files from strangers.

Battery charger - small and large works for me. These are also handy for providing a charge to any pis, badges, or random devices you might use.

Batteries - you'll have electronic badges, and the batteries provided might suck. Bring some good and fresh ones. The few spots that sell them charge an outrageous amount. I'm talking AAAs, AAs, CR2032s.

Solder gear - bring a soldering iron if you can. You're dealing with a lot of the cheapest irons being used by people with varying degrees of skill. The tips can get kinda janky too. Using a bad tip that is about the shape of a pencil ERASER is gonna be a frustrating time for you.

Solder gear pt 2 - If not bringing an iron, bring support items. Bring better solder. Bring better solder wick, solder sucker, desolder braid, flux. Also bring a flush cutter to cut the wires. That small list of stuff is invaluable and can fit in a ziplock bag. HHV generally provides cheap irons with bad tips and the lowest-grade solder. (No fault to them, they're setting it up free, and the tips simply get bad from heavy use).

I've never done a throwaway or burner phone. Lock down / harden your phone and back it up / take an image before you go, and restore from it after. If anyone wanted to target you bad, you're going to have a bad time regardless of what phone you have, but there are probably softer targets anyways. And make friends, don't give people a reason to come after you and your phone should be fine.

## **Inventory**

Footwear - bring two sets of con footwear. I have super-comfy things, but I use two, because sometimes your feet just need to be in something different.

Bags - don't be a damn turtle. I usually either carry what I need in my Utilikilt, or use a small slingbag such as the Bag of Holding and you can add to any bag a [Grid-It system](https://www.amazon.com/OEM-CPG10BK-Grid-It-Organizer-Black/dp/B002HU27UW/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1469391935&sr=8-2&keywords=grid-it) , as this 8x12 fits well. Helps keep smaller things organized, and I also use it to organize charging cables, with the battery at the bottom, and the device able to connect up top.

Bags (2017 Addition) - This [BUBM organizer / bag](https://www.amazon.com/BUBM-Universal-Electronics-Accessories-Large-Black/dp/B00OZN8GL8) is outstanding, and I keep this in my bag now instead of (or sometimes in addition to) the Grid-It.

## **Prepare Thyself**

Start drinking your water now or in the month leading up to DEFCON, just to get the habit up. I scripted a box that pops up at my work computer every hour to have me finish my water and refill.

Start doing drugs. I mean, the multivitamins referenced above, and vitamin D.

If you want to brush up on first aid, or even Wilderness First Aid (for when aid might be a bit distant, which kind of happens in the craziness of the con), and have the means to do so, please do. It'll help us and your fellow con goer.

## **Some last notes:**

This is not to scare you out of the horrors of the con. It is not that bad, just Be Prepared is all that.

If you're having a shit time and can find me (I will make myself identifiable as Belouve), I'll help you out. Goons are also good people too.
